bbbm README file:
----------------------------------------

What is bbbm ?
----------------------------------------
bbbm stands for Blackbox background manager. It shows a collection of
thumbnails, which can be set as the background, or viewed first.
bbbm also allows for setting a random background and creating both a list of
backgrounds, or a Blackbox background submenu.

What are the sytem requirements ?
----------------------------------------
o GTK2 (plus development package).
o GCC and pkgconfig for compiling.

Although the name would suggest that Blackbox is needed, any command to set the
background can be used. GQView is the default image viewer, but this can be
changed as well.

How to compile/install ?
----------------------------------------
Go to the src directory and type 'make'.
Next, as root, type 'make install' to copy the bbbm executable to
/usr/local/bin, or copy it to a directory of choice manually.

How to contact the author (me):
----------------------------------------
Just E-mail all bugreports (and fixes), suggestions or comments to
 ice@iceman13.cjb.net
and place the word `bbbm' somewhere in the subject.
