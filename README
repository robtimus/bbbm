bbbm1 README file:
----------------------------------------

What is bbbm ?
----------------------------------------
bbbm stands for Blackbox background manager. It shows a collection of
thumbnails, which can be set as the background, or viewed first.
bbbm also allows for setting a random background and creating both a list of
backgrounds, or a Blackbox background submenu.

bbbm1 is the PyGTK1 version of bbbm, which is written for PyGTK2.

What are the sytem requirements ?
----------------------------------------
o Python 1.5.2 or higher.
o PyGTK. bbbm is created with PyGTK 0.6.9, but should work with any PyGTK
  version IN THEORY.
o GTK. The version is dependant of the PyGTK version.
o Imlib. The version is dependant of the PyGTK version.
o ImageMagick for creating the thumbnails.

Although the name would suggest that Blackbox is needed, any command to set the
background can be used. GQView is the default image viewer, but this can be
changed as well.

How to compile/install ?
----------------------------------------
just copy the bbbm1 file to a directory in the PATH variable, or to any other
directory of choice.

How to contact the author (me):
----------------------------------------
Just E-mail all bugreports (and fixes), suggestions or comments to
 ice@iceman13.cjb.net
and place the word `bbbm1' somewhere in the subject.
