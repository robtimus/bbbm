bbbm ChangeLog
----------------------------------------

0.4.2
-----
 - Added support for long filenames in the created Blackbox menu (i.e. with
   spaces and characters \, (, ), { and })

0.4.1
-----
 - Zombie child processes are cleaned up now
 - Added modified status (indicated by an asterisk behind the filename)
 - Added confirmation when closing a modified collection

0.4
----
 - Fixed a bug in the Makefile that did not remove /usr/local/bin/bbbm, but
   tried to remove /usr/local/bbbm instead
 - Fixed a bug that (might) let the program crash if executing the set or view
   command would produce an error; the error is now printed to stderr
 - Using absolute, normalized paths now (i.e. no more /../ or /./)
 - Added "Sort On Filename" and "Sort On Description" to Edit menu. Sorting is
   done lexicographically

0.3.1
-----
 - Improved file manager behaviour; makes it easier to jump to directories just
   by typing the name (with thanks to Jari Aalto)

0.3
---
 - Complete rewrite in C (which should make bbbm1 redundant)
 - No longer center bbbm by default, but let the window manager decide
 - Fixed a bug that changed the current filename if a collection was added
 - When changing the thumb size, the current thumbs are finally resized
 - Introduced less strict config file parsing; whitespace is no longer an issue
 - Added "Add Directory..." to Edit menu, which adds all supported images in
   the selected directory
 - Added "Move Back..." and "Move Forward..." to image popup menu
 - "Insert..." can now insert multiple images
 - Added support for commands with spaces in them
 - Added an overwrite check when writing to a file
 - No longer exits a file chooser when nothing is done; the only way to close
   it now is either pressing Cancel, or successfully select a file / directory
 - Extended the statusbar to show the filename of the currently opened
   collection as well
 - Changed accelerator for "Add Collection" to CTRL+C

0.2
---
 - Fixed a bug in the configuration file reading
 - Introduced more error checking; no checking on file permissions though
 - Set scrollbar policy to automatic
 - Added inserting functionality
 - Changed accelerator for "Close" to CTRL+X
