0.8 (2015-10-16)
----------------
 - Moved from SourceForge to GitHub.
 - The build process has been changed to use ./configure.
 - Converted the configuration to use XML. A utility tool (tools/migrate.py) has
   been provided to convert any existing configuration file.
   Note that Python 2 or 3 is required to run this tool (Python 1 won't work).
 - The "view" command has been dropped in favor of a custom command.
 - The list of commands is now dynamic. Commands can be added and removed as
   needed from the options dialog.
 - Added an option to specify a custom configuration file.
 - Added confirmation before deleting images.

0.7.3 (2015-08-23)
------------------
 - Fixed the command in created Blackbox menus if the set command contains %1
 - Fixed Makefile to work on newer systems
 - Removed some compiler warnings

0.7.2 (2007-05-12)
------------------
 - Improved layout of the options dialog a bit
 - Useless menu items are now disabled, such as closing when no file is opened
   or sorting when there are no images. Creating empty lists, menus or
   collections is still allowed though

0.7.1 (2007-03-05)
------------------
 - Increased the default number of extra commands from 5 to 10. A scroll pane
   makes sure the layout is kept intact, no matter the number of commands
 - Added "Add Image List..." to Edit menu, which adds all supported images in
   a text file. This file should have one image file per line
 - Improved command handling. Each %1 inside the command will be replaced by
   the image filename. If there is no %1, the image filename will be appended
   to the command as before

0.7 (2007-03-04)
----------------
 - Added multiple commands that can be executed for an image

0.6.2 (2005-03-23)
------------------
 - Fixed a bug that caused the Set and View options to be messed up when they
   were modified (with thanks to Kevin Tomasek)

0.6.1 (2004-07-03)
------------------
 - Fixed a bug that caused bbbm to crash when trying to open or add an
   unreadable collection

0.6 (2004-06-29)
----------------
 - Changed creation of images; instead of using external ImageMagick command,
   gdk-pixbuf is used

0.5 (2004-06-24)
----------------
 - Rewrote great parts for greater readability
 - Thumbnail size format is checked when reading the config file
 - Added limits to the thumbnail size (screen size)
 - Thumbnail size is split in width and height entries in the Options dialog
 - Slightly changed some menu item labels
 - Set filename status of unnamed collections to "Untitled"
 - Added boolean options "Include filename as label" (filename_label) and
   "Include filename as title" (filename_title), which set the menu label /
   title of created Blackbox menus to the basename of the currently opened
   collection.
   The configuration file is updated automatically for these options

0.4.2 (2004-06-22)
------------------
 - Added support for long filenames in the created Blackbox menu (i.e. with
   spaces and characters \, (, ), { and })

0.4.1 (2004-06-21)
------------------
 - Zombie child processes are cleaned up now
 - Added modified status (indicated by an asterisk behind the filename)
 - Added confirmation when closing a modified collection

0.4 (2004-06-03)
----------------
 - Fixed a bug in the Makefile that did not remove /usr/local/bin/bbbm, but
   tried to remove /usr/local/bbbm instead
 - Fixed a bug that (might) let the program crash if executing the set or view
   command would produce an error; the error is now printed to stderr
 - Using absolute, normalized paths now (i.e. no more /../ or /./)
 - Added "Sort On Filename" and "Sort On Description" to Edit menu. Sorting is
   done lexicographically

   by typing the name (with thanks to Jari Aalto)

----------------

 - No longer center bbbm by default, but let the window manager decide
 - Fixed a bug that changed the current filename if a collection was added
 - When changing the thumb size, the current thumbs are finally resized

   the selected directory
 - Added "Move Back..." and "Move Forward..." to image popup menu
 - "Insert..." can now insert multiple images
 - Added support for commands with spaces in them
 - Added an overwrite check when writing to a file
 - No longer exits a file chooser when nothing is done; the only way to close
   it now is either pressing Cancel, or successfully select a file / directory
 - Extended the statusbar to show the filename of the currently opened
   collection as well
 - Changed accelerator for "Add Collection" to CTRL+C
